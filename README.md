# Turkish SuperLeague Football Teams Project
The aim of the project is to design a short animation on Proteus using a GLCD. The animation is showing Turkish Super League Football Teams on GLCD by pressing keys on keypad. Every key has different football team. For example, when you press 1, then Fenerbahce will be displayed on GLCD or when you press 2, then Besiktas will be displayed. There are 3 buttons for forward, backward and pause image. Interrupts have been used for forward, backward, and pause buttons. Before animation starts, my name/surname, student ID and my animationâ€™s name is being showed at the beginning.
