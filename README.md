# Turkish Super League Football Teams Project

The aim of the project is to design a short animation on Proteus using a GLCD and PIC18F45K22 microprocessor. The animation is showing Turkish Super League Football Teams on GLCD by pressing keys on the keypad. Every key has a different football team. For example, when you press 1, then Fenerbahce will be displayed on GLCD or when you press 2, then Besiktas will be displayed. There are 3 buttons for forwarding, backward, and pause image. Interrupts have been used for forwarding, backward, and pause buttons. Before animation starts, name/surname, student ID, and animationâ€™s name is being shown at the beginning.
